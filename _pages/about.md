<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master’s student in Data Science in Health at UCLA, graduating in 2027, with a strong focus on machine learning and applied data science for healthcare. My work centers on building and evaluating predictive models on real-world clinical data, including time-series forecasting, EHR analysis, and rigorous model benchmarking. I am particularly interested in reproducible ML pipelines and translating statistical methods into robust, practical machine learning systems. I work primarily with Python, R, and SQL, and enjoy tackling problems at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare data, and real-world deployment.

As an aspiring AI practitioner in healthcare, I am actively seeking opportunities to connect with seasoned machine learning experts. I am open to roles where I can contribute and grow, and welcome any guidance and insights.
